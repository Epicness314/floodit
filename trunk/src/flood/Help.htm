<p>The object of the game is to make the entire grid all 
the same color, in as few moves as possible.</p>

<p>When you click one of the buttons at the bottom of the
screen, the square upper left corner turns to that color,
as do all the squares of the same color that are adjacent to it.
And all the squares of the same color that are adjacent to 
<i>those</i> squares. And so on.</p>

<p>Just try it, you'll get the idea. Go for those high scores!</p>
